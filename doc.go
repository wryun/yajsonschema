// Package yajsonschema (yet another json schema [something]) is a tool which converts
// a schema written in yaml into a JSON schema (draft 4). i.e. it's primarily
// an easier way to write json schemas, but you can also use it directly.
//
// However, you can only represent a subest of possible json schema documents.
